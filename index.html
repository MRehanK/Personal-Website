        </div>
        <p>I am a Computer Science major at Lehman College with hands-on experience in IT support, cybersecurity, and software development. I've worked with high-profile organizations, including NYC City Hall and the National Guard, through my role at Innovative Business Concepts, where I managed IT operations and provided Salesforce administration. My cybersecurity internship at IQ4 involved analyzing real-world security breaches and applying the NIST framework. Proficient in Python, Java, and data visualization tools, I have developed projects like data dashboards and interactive applications. Iâ€™m seeking opportunities to further my career in software development, cybersecurity, or data analysis.</p>
